# My NixOs configuration

My NixOs configuration ! For now, as I'm getting to know NixOs, it's just a dumb configuration.nix file, with home manager.

## Installation

To get my config, clone it.

```
https://github.com/Seowlfh/nix-config.git
```

You also have to add the [Home Manager Channel](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager). You can use these commands:

```
sudo nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/release-22.11.tar.gz home-manager
sudo nix-channel --update
```
