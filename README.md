# My NixOs configuration

My NixOs configuration ! For now, as I'm getting to know NixOs, it's just a dumb configuration.nix file, with home manager.

## Installation

To get my config, clone it.

```
https://github.com/Seowlfh/nix-config.git
```

You also have to add the [Home Manager Channel](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager). You can follow the [standalone installation procedure](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.html#sec-install-standalone)

## Dependencies
